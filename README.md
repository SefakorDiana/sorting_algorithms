0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project is done by Ron Aryeetey and Sefakor Acquah

This project aided us to grasp the following concepts:

At least four different sorting algorithms
What the Big O notation is, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
And finally what a stable sorting algorithm is.
